# Notebooks Directory

Use this folder for exploratory and reporting notebooks that accompany the centralized analysis.

## Suggested Notebook Types
- Data characterization reports leveraging TrajData feature extraction.
- Clustering experiments comparing manual heuristics and algorithmic results.
- Performance evaluation dashboards summarizing Trajectron++ metrics across clusters.

## Next Steps
- Register the project virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel (`ipykernel`).
- Draft an initial EDA notebook to inspect per-agent and per-scene statistics.
- Outline a results notebook that compiles plots exported from `results/`.
