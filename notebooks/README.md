# Notebooks Directory

Use this folder for exploratory and reporting notebooks that accompany the centralized analysis.

## Current Notebooks
- `00_setup_validation.ipynb` — Verifies environment setup, dataset access, and trajdata functionality.

## Planned Notebook Types
- Data characterization reports leveraging trajdata feature extraction.
- Clustering experiments comparing manual heuristics and algorithmic results.
- Performance evaluation dashboards summarizing Trajectron++ metrics across clusters.

## Next Steps
- Draft an initial EDA notebook (`01_data_characterization.ipynb`) to inspect per-agent and per-scene statistics.
- Outline a results notebook that compiles plots exported from `results/`.
