# Data Characterization Plots

Store visualizations from the nuScenes exploratory data analysis here.

## Suggested Plots
- Agent type distributions (cars, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.)
- Trajectory length and duration statistics
- Scene complexity metrics (agent counts, interaction density)
- Spatial heatmaps (trajectory start/end positions, high-traffic zones)
- Temporal patterns (time of day, weather conditions)
- Velocity and acceleration profiles

## Naming Convention
Use descriptive filenames with underscores:
- `agent_type_distribution.png`
- `trajectory_length_histogram.png`
- `scene_complexity_by_location.png`
- `velocity_profiles_by_agent_type.png`
