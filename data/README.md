# Data Directory

Store nuScenes raw data, derived feature caches, and metadata exports here. Raw datasets should remain excluded from version control; rely on download scripts or external storage. A convenience `.gitignore` protects against accidentally committing heavy assets.

## Suggested Contents
- `raw/` pointers or symlinks to the official nuScenes release.
- `processed/` serialized feature tensors for Trajectron++.
- `metadata/` summaries describing manual and algorithmic cluster memberships.

## Acquisition Workflow
1. Create a nuScenes account at https://www.nuscenes.org/download and accept the license.
2. Download the **v1.0-mini** dataset and the **Map expansion pack (v1.3)**.
3. Extract both archives and organize under `raw/`:
   ```
   raw/
   ├── maps/
   │   ├── expansion/
   │   │   ├── boston-seaport.json
   │   │   ├── singapore-hollandvillage.json
   │   │   ├── singapore-onenorth.json
   │   │   └── singapore-queenstown.json
   │   └── (map image files)
   ├── samples/
   ├── sweeps/
   └── v1.0-mini/
   ```
4. Run `notebooks/00_setup_validation.ipynb` to verify the setup and trigger trajdata cache creation.
5. Populate `processed/` with reusable feature caches generated by scripts in `src/` (see forthcoming preprocessing utilities).

## Next Steps
- Document any environment variables or secrets (e.g., `NUSCENES_ROOT`) required for automated scripts.
- Create scripts in `src/` to populate `processed/` artifacts reproducibly.
- Maintain lightweight manifest files in `metadata/` to describe manual and algorithmic clusters.
